# Smart-Contract-Applicaiton-in-Construction-Industry

## Introduction to the project
    The construction industry is notorious for low-efficiency and corruption. Besides obvious reasons like complexity of large institutions, numerous involving parties and complexity of large contracts, there are two characteristics that make this industry hard to mitigate: One is that the uniqueness of construction projects that no two construction projects are the same makes it difficult to compare two projects and set benchmarks for expenses. Another one is that construction projects often have complex transaction chains, which make it hard to detect inflated costs and of course to regulate the wrongdoing. The condition calls for powerful tools to be introduced to mitigate the loss.

## How bad is the problem?
    According to the World Economic Forum, the value of global construction is expected to increase by $8 trillion to reach $17.5 trillion per annum by 2030. It is hard to determine precisely how much money has been lost due to corruption precisely, but it is estimated that the loss tends to range between 10% and 30% of the total value.1 This means by 2030, nearly $6 trillion could be lost annually unless measures are introduced.

## Objective of the project
    The purpose of our project is to create a decentralized tracking platform designed specifically for the construction industry that will improve efficiency and reduce corruption. A smart contract will be developed, which includes all participants of construction projects: funding, engineers, contractors, fabricators, and transportation. It will have predefined rules, regulations, and penalties for all parties and be self-executed.
